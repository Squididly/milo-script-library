## Note about ui_dta.zip
This is a password-protected zip of scripts that were found with the loose scripts the game actually makes use of. The password is **112358**. John the Ripper made quick work of it.

These appear to be the original PS2 versions of the scripts Secret Level used as part of their ports. There's a lot more references to PS2 materials in them than in the loose scripts.

Just putting this note here. You don't need to re-extract the zip. The files are in ui_dta/.
