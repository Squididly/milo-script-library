(subtitle_tut_push_narr_020

(subtitle_tut_push_narr_030
   "Punch straight ahead of you, quick and deliberate. Yen Sid insists on Push Cues being hit properly. Obsessed with them, he is.")
(subtitle_tut_push_narr_040
   "You've hit the goal! You'd best take leave of these woods now. There are \ncreatures lurking about that even I've never seen. Nor do I want to.")
(subtitle_ys05_2_return_1cs_01

(subtitle_ys05_2_return_1cs_02

(subtitle_ys05_2_return_1cs_03
   "I wonder what would happen if the two of you were ever to meet. ")
(subtitle_beat_511_narr_010
   "You're doing quite well, surprisingly. Shame Yen Sid's last apprentice didn't have your focus. Unfortunate story that was... \nYes... Still, heh heh, onward and upward, right? Two stars down, two to go. To the Nation!")
(subtitle_tut_path_narr_010

(subtitle_tut_path_narr_020

(subtitle_tut_path_narr_030

(subtitle_tut_path_narr_040
   "You did it! Go and show your star to Yen Sid. Oh, act all cool like it was nothing. He won't expect that.")
(subtitle_ys06_3_return_1cs_01
   "You continue to impress. ")
(subtitle_beat_611_narr_010
   "Indeed, you're an excellent student. Quite a relief after that last apprentice quit... Anyway, \njust one star left, in The Press, if I'm not mistaken. So let's press on!")
(subtitle_tut_sust_narr_010
   "Now, for this goal, remember what I taught you about Path Cues.")
(subtitle_tut_sust_narr_020
   "You punch forward, then trace the path. ")

   "With confidence!")
(subtitle_tut_sust_narr_040

(subtitle_tut_2hand_narr_030

(subtitle_tut_2hand_narr_040
   "Switch Cues combine a Punch, then a Sweep. Punch forward with one hand, then quickly sweep up.")
(subtitle_tut_2hand_narr_050
   "Hit a Switch Cue properly and you'll earn a score multiplier for the next section.")
(subtitle_tut_2hand_narr_060
   "Boost your multiplier enough and you'll meet the goal. Careful, though: if you miss a Switch Cue, your multiplier will reset.")
(subtitle_tut_2hand_narr_070
   "It's a little bit tricky, so let's practice, shall we? Punch, then sweep to perform these Switch Cues.")
(subtitle_tut_songbuild_narr_010
   "To begin the song, switch on all the instruments.")
(subtitle_tut_songbuild_narr_020
   "Keep going! The highlighted instruments will begin to play as you switch them on.")
(subtitle_tut_songbuild_narr_030
   "We call this \qThe Mix Switcher.\q A bit pedestrian, but it gets the job done.")
(subtitle_tut_songbuild_narr_040
   "Try that again. Remember, Switch Cues are performed in two steps: punch forward, \nthen sweep upward. You'll need to hit a couple in a row to boost your multiplier and hit the goal.")
(subtitle_tut_songbuild_narr_050
   "You've earned the Moon, and you've mastered these basic tests. Impressive. \nI do believe Yen Sid will have something for you. I hope it's ice cream cake.")
(subtitle_ys08_5_return_1cs_01

   "What comes next will challenge your will and determination. ")
(subtitle_ys08_5_return_1cs_05

   "Scout's ideas may be bold, but her enthusiasm outweighs her experience. \nPerhaps you could help her uncover the secret of the Remix Spell.")
(subtitle_tut_remix_narr_020
   "Now this will be a real challenge -- to succeed, you'll need to hit the Score Goal to reveal a new mix color. \nAnd when the next Switch Cue appears, punch, then sweep towards the new color to unlock it.")
(subtitle_tut_remix_narr_025
   "After that, you can choose instruments from either mix using the Switch Cue.")
(subtitle_tut_remix_narr_030
   "I'm sure you can do this... mostly. Remember: first earn the score, then switch to the new remix.")
(subtitle_tut_remix_narr_031
   "Now! Punch, then sweep towards the Pink Mix!")
(subtitle_tut_remix_narr_033
   "You did it! You've changed the song from within!")
(subtitle_tut_remix_narr_040
   "Oh, so close! Take a deep breath and try again. Earn a high score, then select the new mix with a Switch Cue.")
(subtitle_tut_remix_narr_050
   "Astounding! You've actually got Scout's Remix Spell to work. Let's see what she thinks of that.")
(subtitle_sc09_turning_point_1_cs_003

(subtitle_sc09_turning_point_1_cs_05
   "I mean, you changed the song from the inside. That's huge. \nI couldn't get it to work, but you did. It must be all of the power you've earned...")
(subtitle_sc09_turning_point_1_cs_06
   "Okay, we have to try that again! There's no telling what we can do now. \nAh! This is going to be so cool. I know exactly which song we need.")
(subtitle_sc09_turning_point_1_cs_07_org
   "There it is! Looks pretty special, right? We should play it! It's a long way off but I bet you can reach it from here. Go ahead.")

   "Oh no...")
(subtitle_sc09_turning_point_1_cs_09

   "What if you could fight the Noise IN the realms? I mean, you've got The Hat. I could stay here and try to fix the song.")

   "Yen Sid told me that one day I'd create a grand work. He showed me this star, shining up in the sky, waiting to be composed. \nHe said it was mine and I... I just, I really wanted to see what it might be, you know? ")
(subtitle_sc15_2_return_2_cs_03
   "I shouldn't have tried to skip ahead. I mean, if I'd finished my apprenticeship, I could do all the cool stuff you do.")
(subtitle_sc15_2_return_2_cs_04
   "But all I got was Noise. Lots and lots of Noise that's destroying the things I love. ")
(subtitle_sc15_2_return_2_cs_05
   "Wait, maybe that's it. What if I write this song, \nlike I'm supposed to? And then you could play it! Maybe that would get rid of the Noise for good.")

   "Okay, get back out there and find us more magic. I'm going to get to work.")
(subtitle_beat_1511_narr_010

(subtitle_beat_1511_narr_020
   "It'll take three more Composition Spells to complete Scout's song. \nYou'll have to explore all of the Noise-infested realms to uncover them.")

(subtitle_sc18_3_return_2_cs_01

(subtitle_sc18_3_return_2_cs_02
   "It's all helping me fix this.")
(subtitle_sc18_3_return_2_cs_03

(subtitle_sc21_4_return_2_cs_01
