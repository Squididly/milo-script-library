# Milo Script Library

This is a repository for the raw scripts in as many Harmonix titles as we have ripped and available to us. Usually these scripts are in Harmonix's homebrew Lisp-like Data Array language, though *FreQuency*, their earliest title, used Python 1 instead. (The name "Milo" refers to the name Harmonix themselves gave their game engine. Nearly all of their games share the same engine with upgrades and improvements made over time.)

Some games (namely *Rock Band* for the PS2 and the *Amplitude* PS2 OPM demo) feature these scripts in their raw DTA format, and thus contain Harmonix's original comments, an invaluable insight into their development process. Most other games have had their DTBs (the tokenized and encrypted script format the game actually reads) converted to DTA; these are therefore missing comments.

Some Harmonix titles, including the final build of *Amplitude* PS2 and the early *Karaoke Revolution* titles, use a currently unknown flavor of Data Array that we've yet to be able to get anything useful out of. These games are omitted as a result.
